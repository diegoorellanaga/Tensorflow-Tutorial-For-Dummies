### Basic-1-1dimensional-nn.py ###

This script contains a 1-6-6-1 neural network that is trained with a sinusoid data. The purpose of this code is to easily show how to build a simple neural network. When I was looking for tutorials about simple neural networks in tensorflow I didn't find any good explanation or any neural network simple enough to explain the tensorflow syntax. I hope this helps you to better understand how to use tensorflow.
